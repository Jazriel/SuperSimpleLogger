# SuperSimpleLogger
Super Simple Logger developed with TDD (and more than necessary commits) in order to show and understand TDD.

There will be a commit on "Red" -> Added Test and tried to pass the app with it but app necessarily fails.

Another on "Green" -> Added code to pass the test in 'Red'

Another on "Refactor" -> Refactor code so that it is easily usable, readable and maintainable.
